>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Methods<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

1.Combine 1/2 cup water, sugar, and yeast in a small bowl,
 stirring with a whisk. Let stand 5 minutes or until yeast
 mixture is bubbly.
2.Weigh or lightly spoon flours, potato starch, and flaxseed
 meal into dry measuring cups; level with a knife. Combine flours,
 potato starch, flaxseed meal, xanthan gum, and salt in a large bowl;
 beat with a mixer at medium speed until blended. Add yeast mixture,
 1 tablespoon oil, egg whites, and egg; beat at low speed 1 minute or
 until combined. Increase speed to medium; beat 2 minutes.
3.Coat a baking sheet with 1 teaspoon oil. Scrape dough onto pan.
 Lightly coat hands with oil. Press dough into a 14-inch circle,
 coating hands with oil as needed to prevent dough from sticking.
 Coat top of dough with any remaining oil. Cover with plastic wrap,
 and let rise in a warm place (85°), free from drafts, for 30 minutes.
4.Preheat oven to 400°.
5.Remove plastic wrap, and bake crust at 400° for 17 minutes or until
 bottom lightly browns. Cool completely. Increase oven temperature to 425°.
6.Spread marinara over crust, leaving a 1/2-inch border; top with mozzarella
 cheese, pepperoni, and Parmesan cheese. Bake at 425° for 16 minutes or
 until crust is golden and cheese melts.
